Installation:

- Edit the top level Makefile and change what is needed. The only
critical configuration option for TinyGL is the endianness of your
platform. The other options are required to compile the examples. You
can link the examples with either OpenGL, Mesa or TinyGL.

- Type 'make'. The library 'libTinyGL.a' is copied into './lib'. The
examples are build in './example1' and './example2'. Only the
directories './lib' and './include' are needed to use TinyGL from
another program.
